\title{Gwet's AC1 and AC2}
\description{Calculates Gwet's AC as index of agreement for two observations of nominal, ordinal, or ratio scale data.}
\usage{gac(data = NULL, kat = NULL, weight = c("unweighted","linear","quadratic","ratio"),
    conf.level = 0.95)}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{A matrix with n subjects and two observations (n*2 matrix)}
  \item{kat}{Number of possible categories}
  \item{weight}{A character string specifying "unweighted", "linear", "quadratic" or "ratio", or a numeric kat*kat matrix with custom weights (see details).}
  \item{conf.level}{Confidence level of the interval.}
}
\details{
Gwet's AC has the advantage of not relying on independence between observations (Gwet, 2008), making it suitable for data with dependent measurements. Weights are based on weighted dissimilarities (diagonal = 1, off-diagonal < 1). Linear weights decrease equally with distance from the diagonal and quadratic weights decrease exponentially with distance from the diagonal. Custom weights should be specified as a kat*kat matrix with values <= 1. Incomplete cases are omitted listwise and the confidence interval is based on a t distribution.
